<h2>About Snug Pines</h2>
<p>Welcome to Snug Pines, where every hoodie brings the calm, cozy vibes of the forest to your wardrobe. Our designs are inspired by nature — soft greens, gentle beiges, and warm earthy tones — to make you feel comfortable and peaceful wherever you go.</p>
<p>Each hoodie is handmade with love, using soft, high-quality fabrics that feel as cozy as a walk through the woods. We take pride in creating pieces that are unique, comfortable, and full of forest-inspired charm.</p>
